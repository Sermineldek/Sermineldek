           Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Åžermin


I'm trying to improve myself in a software testing engineering field based in Turkey.

I've been training in this field for about a year. I have a passion for learning new concepts and technologhies. My goal is to grow as a person by learning new skills and languages. I want to use that knowledge to selve real world problems and contribute to the community. 


- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java and Test Automation.
- ðŸ“ƒ I write articles https://medium.com/@sermineldek.
- âš¡ I am currently trying to improve myself and open to work.
